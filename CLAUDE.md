## Fork Maintenance Rules

### New Command Documentation Protocol
When adding new commands:
1. Create the command file in `.claude/commands/[command].md`
2. Update `.claude/commands/index.md` (increment total count, add to categories)
3. Update `COMMANDS.md` (add to appropriate section, increment section count)
4. **ALWAYS update `FORK_CHANGES.md`** with the new command details, features, and commit reference
5. Update changelog documentation as needed
6. Test thoroughly before deployment

### Fork Change Tracking Protocol
**CRITICAL**: Before any commit or PR that adds/modifies commands or features:
1. **Update `FORK_CHANGES.md`** with detailed entry including:
   - Command name and file path
   - Purpose and key features
   - Commit hash and PR number (when available)
   - Any breaking changes or migration notes
2. This ensures clear fork maintenance and upstream tracking
3. **Never commit new commands without updating FORK_CHANGES.md**

### Documentation Standards
- Maintain professional technical accuracy
- Include appropriate warning labels and risk documentation
- Document functionality, parameters, and use cases clearly
- Focus on practical utility over entertainment
